// import axios from 'axios'

// //configure and export the Axios object that we will use to make HTTP requests to the relevant remote API through this code

// export default axios.create({

//     //This setting here is necessary. Because during the development phase, the technology that the remote machine is using to expose the relevant API endpoints is called ngrok.
//     //we need to include this http header setting in order for our client HTTP requests to not be blocked by cors because the relevant web API is running in a different domain, or origin.
